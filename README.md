CandidateKeysFinder
===================
An implementation for the algorithm that finds keys of a relational (R), based on a list of Functional Dependecies (FDs).
There are several algorithms implementation including Closure,Combination and keys Finder. Part of these algorithms are derived from ( or based on ) some answers in stackoverflow such as .... [TODO]
